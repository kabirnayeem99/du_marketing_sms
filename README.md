# About

DU Marketing is a school management software developed for Dhaka University Marketing Department, to make managing the day-to-day administrative tasks of them  easier and more modern. It will enable them to digitally monitor the daily activities along with managing all the resources and information on a single platform.

This app helps marketing department to make announcements, publish or modify class routines, share images and other related information. There is a user facing software designed to be used by the students, named '[DU Marketing (Student)](https://github.com/kabirnayeem99/du_marketing_student/)', which is also open-source and free-to-use.  

This application is very light-weight, fast, simple in feature but very good at what it does. This application was built using Native Android SDK and Kotlin. It uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as its back-end.
